# Basic-Dice-game
Created this basic dice game as a learning project for javascript

In javascript code a random number is generated with the help of Math.random() and with the help of that created a random source variable and 
finally change the attribute of image with randomSource so that a new image of dice gets generated everytime

Based on randomNumbers generated winners are declared
